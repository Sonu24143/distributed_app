# Anomaly detector for weather prediction
This is a simple fun project which collects data points for
- weather forecast
- real time weather details

(Data courtesy of https://openweathermap.org/)

it tries to identify and provide deviation of actual vs predicted statistics near real time, helping understand how to leverage distributed computing to solve latency, availability and scale issues.
